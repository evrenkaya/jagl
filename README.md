# Java Abstract Graph Library

This is an open source project I started in my spare time to practice using git/github with a new Java API.

This API currently handles the storage of Graphs(i.e. vertices and edges and some Graph algorithms.
Some of the types of graphs that can be created:
- Undirected
- Directed
- Weighted
- Simple
- Multiple edge

Some of the algorithms supported:
- Depth first search
- Breadth first search
- Connected Sub-Graph Determination
